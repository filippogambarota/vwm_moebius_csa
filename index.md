# Repository Content

This repository contains all files related to my research project about Visual Working Memory functions in Moebius Patients.

This work was presented during the [Cognitive Science Arena](https://cogsci.unibz.it/), Brixen (BZ, Italy), February 7-8th, 2020. This is the [online version of the poster](reporting/poster/VMW_Moebius_Poster.html)

## Data

The **data folder** contains `raw` and `processed` data of the experiment.

* The `raw` data file is the output (cleaned from sensitive data) of the [EPrime](https://pstnet.com/products/e-prime/) experiment routine.
* The `cleaned` folder contains the output of the `data_creation.R` script.

## Scripts

The **script folder** contains the scripts for creating the `cleaned` dataset and for the statistical analysis presented during the conference.

* `data_creation.R`
* `analysis.R`

## Reporting

The **reporting folder** contains all the files for generating the html *poster*.

## Objects

The **objects folder** contains large objects generated by the `analysis.R` script.

## Packrat

The **packrat folder** contains all R packages used inside the project.

## Experiment

The **experiment folder** contains all files related to the experimental setting in particular:
* The **EPrime file** for the experiment
* The **Pipeline** for creating the stimuli
* All **stimuli** presented during the experiment

# Files Documentation

In the code I mainly use the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) approach.

The final dataset inside the `data/cleaned` folder is a long form dataset beacause of the repeated measure design where each row is an experimental trial and each column is a variable. The variables are:
* **Subject**: is the subject number from 1 to 37. 1-7 regards the Moebius group and 8-37 the control group.
* **Group**: a 2 levels factor for Moebius and Controls
* **Emotion**: a 3 levels factor for the emotional face in the specific trial
* **Memory**: a variable that represents the to-be-remembered image (from 0 to 7)
* **Mem**: the same variable as **Memory** but trasformed in factor
* **Test**: the pressed image by the subject
* **Test_Memory_Abs**: the response variable in all analysis that is computed as $Test\;-Memory$. Where 0 is a correct answer and from 1 to 7 an increasing error.
